# 🔐 **Synthetic Dataset Generator** 

## ⚠️ **Important Note**

This application is designed to generate **synthetic datasets** while maintaining **privacy**. We ensure the generated datasets preserve the statistical properties of the original data while masking any **sensitive information** such as names, phone numbers, and unique identifiers.

Please go through the code and description of the **synthetic data generation process** in this repository: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/lokesh-kummari/Synthetic_Data_Generator)

## 🌟 **Brief**

In today’s world, **data privacy** is a key concern, especially when working with sensitive data. Our AI-driven solution generates **synthetic datasets** that preserve **privacy** and **statistical consistency**. By analyzing the original dataset's statistical characteristics, we use LLM's to  generate synthetic data that mimics the original dataset without exposing sensitive information. 

This solution provides a **secure**, **privacy-preserving** alternative for working with datasets, ensuring that **data-driven decisions** can still be made without compromising **user privacy**.
